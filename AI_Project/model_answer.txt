Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent
machines
that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning,
reasoning,
problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data
without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms improve automatically through experience.
There are three main types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
Applications of AI include healthcare, banking, fraud detection, education, robotics,
and natural language processing. AI improves efficiency, accuracy, and automation in modern
systems.
